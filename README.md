## Description

This project was inspired by the board game [Hues and Cues](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/302520/hues-and-cues). I wanted to make a website version that I could play with my friends. This website can be accessed at [johnprovazek.com/hintsandtints](https://www.johnprovazek.com/hintsandtints/). It is currently in the early stages of development.

Built using React and Google Firebase.

## Credits

[How to Deploy Create React App to GitHub Pages? (Custom Domain & GitHub Actions)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5DTIf-jWhk&ab_channel=AntonPutra) was used to set this react app up with GitHub Pages.

## Bugs & Improvements

- The gh-pages branch display is not consistent with the local server display. For some reason the H row is missing.
- Determine what size screens are too small and display an error message.
- Start connecting this application with Google Firebase.
