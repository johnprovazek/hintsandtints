## Description

This project was created because I really enjoy the board game [Hues and Cues](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/302520/hues-and-cues) and wanted to make a website version to play with my friends. This website can be accessed at [johnprovazek.com/hintsandtints](https://www.johnprovazek.com/hintsandtints/). It is currently in the early stages of development.

Built using React and Google Firebase.

## Credits

[How to Deploy Create React App to GitHub Pages? (Custom Domain & GitHub Actions)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5DTIf-jWhk&ab_channel=AntonPutra) was used to set this react app up with GitHub Pages.

## Bugs & Improvements

- gh-pages branch is not consitent with local branch.
- Determine what size screens are too small and display an error message.
- Start connecting application with Google Firebase.
